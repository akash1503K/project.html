        <h2>I Want to Open Up About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Akash Krishnan. I am a passionate web developer with hands-on experience gained during my
            internship at Entry. I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration from William Carey University in
            Meghalaya,
            where I developed a solid foundation in both business and technical skills. My education journey began at
            Pope
            Pius XI Higher Secondary School, which prepared me well for my future endeavors. In addition to my web
            development skills, I have experience working as a staff member at an international airport, where I gained
            valuable insights into operations and customer service. I also have experience working with the finance
            team,
            which has enhanced my analytical skills. I possess moderate proficiency in Microsoft Excel, Word, and
            PowerPoint, allowing me to effectively communicate and present my ideas. I am eager to continue developing
            my
            skills and contributing to innovative projects in the web development field.
