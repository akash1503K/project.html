            <p>"The idea of 'Tail Globe' comes from the thought that the Earth we live on now was once home to many
                different creatures, some of which we see today and some we don't. Many species have faced extinction
                without our awareness. Therefore, if we can talk about and love the living beings around us, it can
                bring a
                significant change to nature and our lifestyle. I believe that the change we experience by raising a pet
                is
                substantial, and this belief is the foundation of this application."</p>

    <p>"Through the Tail Globe app, you can find and sell your favorite pets. You can see the pets you like in
        person and buy them if you wish. You can also purchase food, medications, and grooming supplies needed for
        your pets. Additionally, the app will feature a pets gallery where you can upload photos and videos of your
        pet. If your pets fall ill, you can search for a good hospital and maintain a good contact through our app.
        Tail Globe will always be there to help keep your pets safe."</p>

            <p>The idea behind "Aid for All" is indeed to simplify daily life and ensure that everyone can access
                resources
                and support equally. This initiative aims to address various needs—whether they are related to food,
                healthcare, education, or other essential services—so that individuals from all backgrounds can benefit.
                By
                focusing on accessibility and inclusivity, the goal is to create a more equitable society where everyone
                has
                the opportunity to thrive.</p>
